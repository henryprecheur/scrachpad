I'm learning rc[1] right now. This one took me a while to figure out:

  ; for (i in 1 100 10) { echo $i } | sort
  1
  100
  10

It turns out that this is not what I expected: I though that the 3 numbers would be sorted. Here's how rc interprets it:

  for (i in 1 100 10) { echo $i | sort }

What I wanted was:

  { for (i in 1 100 10) echo $i } | sort
