I lost my rear bike light today. I went to Canadian Tire to get a new one, I was underwelm by the choice and the price. A crappy looking rear light was $9; batteries not-included. I'm cheap, I didn't buy it.

I went to MEC[1] instead. There for the same price I got a rear light and a small front light, batteries included. A friendly service was also included.

I should know better, specialist store have almost always cheaper and/or have more choice than generalist.
