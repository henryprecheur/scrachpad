It took me a long time to figure that one out:

        $ awk '/\.\./ { print "2. " $0; next }
               /\./ { print "1. " $0; next }
               { print }' <<EOF
        > foo
        > .foo
        > ..foo
        > EOF
        foo
        1. .foo
        2. ..foo

I didn't know that command next[1] which allows you to jump to the next line without executing the other rules.
