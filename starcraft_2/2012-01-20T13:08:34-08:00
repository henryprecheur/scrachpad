Played 2 games today. Both were 3 Rax all-ins[1].

1st was against a Protoss on Shattered temple. I fucked up, lost a SCV, forgot to put one back to build the Baracks. I left right away, I don't think it's smart to stay in a game if you screw up early. Better start over and get a 'real' game going.

2nd, against another Protoss was a win. He didn't manage to scout me before my 3 Rax completed. Easy win. 3 Rax all-in is pretty strong at low levels.
