After working at Image-Engine, I realized how important color temperature is. When you take a picture indoor and it looks all yellowish, that's because the ambient color temperature[1] is 'low'. Most cheapish light bulds have a color temperature around 3000K. When you are outside, the color temperature is usually between 4000K and 6500K.

Today I decided to replace the light buld over my desk at home with a 5000K+ light. Since almost nobody knows about color temperature, it is mostly absent from the technical specifications of cheapish light bulds. it's hard to know which one to buy. Luckily the Energy star website has a complete list[2] of its certified light bulbs, with their respective color temperature.

I'll probably get a Philips 'Mini Twister Daylight Compact Fluorescent Bulb', it is supposed to be 'daylight'-like, with a color temperature of 6500K & a good luminance.
